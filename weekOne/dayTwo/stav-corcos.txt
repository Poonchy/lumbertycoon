5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    - The box model consists of regions around content. Margins is deadspace outside of the border, followed by a border, then dead space between content and the border called padding, then the space the content takes up. Two ways to fix this is to merge all of the margin and padding and border into the width specified with box-sizing: border-box, or by specifying no margins and padding for the page beforehand to prevent elements from taking up unecessary space.
